# GraphQL-Server-Kit
![GraphQL Logo](./assets/graphql.png "GraphQL Logo")


Getting Started with a GraphQL Server can sometimes seem intimadating. There's a good amount of overhead involved in set up with redundant code and dependencies. To save time, I built a GraphQL Server Kit for easily getting started with GraphQL with all the necessary and helpful packages pre-installed. The server is built on Node.js with Express.js and GraphQL sitting on top.

# Dependencies

### Key

* [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/server) - An open source solution for easily building a GraphQL API

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) -  Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

***
### Middleware

* [Cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#readme) - CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.

* [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) - Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. Itâ€™s not a silver bullet, but it can help!  

* [Compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) - Node.js compression middleware.

* [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) - HTTP request logger middleware for node.js

### Development

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. 

* [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) - ESLint is an open source project originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. Its goal is to provide a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript. 

* [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.

### Other

* [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology. 

* [Body-Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) -  Node.js body parsing middleware. Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
